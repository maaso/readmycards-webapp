[Website Trust1Team][Trust1Team-url]

## Summary

Only works from Kong 0.8.0

## Launch dev docker container
Pull container from docker hub:
```ssh
$ docker pull trust1team/t1c-webapp-demo
```
Launch container:
```ssh
$ docker run --name t1c-webapp-demo -p9000:80 -d trust1team/t1c-webapp-demo
```

## Development build

In order to run the demo, checkout the code and run
```ssh
$ nmp install
$ bower install
$ grunt serve
```

In order to deploy to the T1T demo page in the cloud, be sure to manually copy-paste the correct keycloak config in the keycloak.json file. 

## Create new development Docker container
1) build new image
```ssh
$ docker build -t t1c-webapp-demo .
```
2) Validate image - Launch docker dev environment (you have to expose port 9000 because authentication happens with predefined port)
```ssh
$ docker run --name t1c-webapp-demo -p9000:80 -d t1c-webapp-demo
```
3) get image ID in order to tag
```ssh
$ docker images
```
4) create tag
```ssh
$ docker tag cc5a5f646ae5 trust1team/t1c-webapp-demo:latest
```
5) login into docker hub (ask admin to add account to Trust1Team org)
```ssh
$ docker login
```
6) push the new tag
```ssh
$ docker push trust1team/t1c-webapp-demo:latest
```
