ReadMyCards is a simple webapp that reads the contents of your smartcards using any capable reader.

[Website Trust1Team][Trust1Team-url]

## Changelog

### v1.1.2

* Fix card selection dialog not behaving correctly when multiple readers + cards are connected

### v1.1.1

* Fix for ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED error in Chrome
* Removed some unused scripts

## Requirements

* Node.js v6.9.2 LTS or higher

## Running Development build
Run npm install:
```ssh
$ npm install
```
Start the node.js process:
```ssh
$ npm start
```
If you have nodemon installed you can also run
```ssh
$ nodemon app.js
```
a nodemon.json configuration is present that will only trigger a nodemon restart when server files are changed.

Now that the server is running, you can also start a livereload server with grunt:
```ssh
$ grunt serve
```

*If you use both nodemon and livereload, all changes made to either server or client will trigger reloads and become available in your development environment.*

## Deployment
Clone the repository in your desired directory and switch to the correct release tag.

Now run the deployment script
```ssh
$ nmp run deploy
```
This script will pull in all dependencies and build a minfied/uglified/concatted distribution package in the /dist folder

Create a configuration YAML file called *config.yml* in the */config* directory. An example is provided. Make sure you change the environment to something other than *local*.

A full deployment guide can be found on [Confluence][rmc-confluence-deployment-guide]
